# magicmaze
## Introduction
This project was made for CPSC 340, to focus on reading files, building arrays from files, 
reading arguments, generating binary trees, and error handling. The concept is that the player is stuck in a maze
and must choose left/right paths in order to find a wizard to escape. Encountering other creatures or reaching the 
end of a branch is gameover
